# RiskManagement-GWP2-Financial-Regime-Analysis-with-HMMs
Welcome to our project repository! Here, we explore how Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) can help us understand different phases in financial markets, like bullish (upward trends), bearish (downward trends), and stable periods.
## Why This Project?
We aim to improve how we measure and manage risks in financial markets. Traditional methods have limitations, so we're using HMMs to better capture complex market behaviors. This helps investors make smarter decisions by predicting market conditions more accurately.

## What You'll Find Here
### HMM Basics: 
We've implemented HMMs in Python to analyze market data.
### Identifying Market Phases: 
Our models help classify market phases based on volatility (how much prices change), trend direction (whether prices are going up or down), and trading patterns.
### Visualizing Results: 
You can see these market phases visually, overlaid on historical price data, to understand how markets behave over time.
